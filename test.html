<h1>ReStructuredText (rst): plain text markup</h1>


<h1>What is reStructuredText?</h1>
<p>
An easy-to-read, what-you-see-is-what-you-get plaintext markup syntaxand parser system, abbreviated *rst*. In other words, using a simpletext editor, documents can be created which
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
are easy to read in text editor and
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
can be *automatically* converted to
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
  - html and 
</p>
<p>
  - latex (and therefore pdf)
</p>
<h1>What is it good for?</h1>
<p>
reStructuredText can be used, for example, to
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
write technical documentation (so that it can easily be offered as apdf file or a web page)
</p>
<p>
My own paragraph goes here bro.  Seriously::
</p>
<pre>
  YEAH BUDDY

</pre>
<p>
What?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
create html webpages without knowing html 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
to document source code
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Show me some formatting examples</h1>
<p>
You can highlight text in *italics* or, to provide even more emphasisin **bold**. Often, when describing computer code, we like to use a``fixed space font`` to quote code snippets.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
We can also include footnotes [1]_. We could include source code files(by specifying their name) which is useful when documenting code. Wecan also copy source code verbatim (i.e. include it in the rstdocument) like this::
</p>
<pre>
  int main ( int argc, char *argv[] ) {
      printf("Hello World\n");
      return 0;
  }

</pre>
<p>
We have already seen at itemised list in section `What is it goodfor?`_. Enumerated list and descriptive lists are supported aswell. It provides very good support for including html-links in avariety of ways. Any section and subsections defined can be linked to,as well.
</p>
<h1>Where can I learn more?</h1>
<p>
reStructuredText is described athttp://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html. We provide some geeky smallprint in this footnote [2]_.
</p>
<p>'Things are awesome.' &mdash; Sherlock Holmes
<h1>Show me some more stuff, please</h1>
<p>
We can also include figures:
</p>

<p>
   :width: 300pt
</p>
<p>
   The magnetisation in a small ferromagnetic disk. The diametre is of the order of 120 nanometers and the material is Ni20Fe80. Png is a file format that is both acceptable for html pages as well as for (pdf)latex.
</p>
<hr />


<p>
  - Emacs provides an rst mode   - when converting rst to html, a style sheet can be provided (there is a similar feature for latex)  - rst can also be converted into XML  - the recommended file extension for rst is ``.txt``
</p>
